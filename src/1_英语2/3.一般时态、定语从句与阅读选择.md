2. 一般过去时，过去发生的事情，和现在没联系 I loved you.  我爱过你
3. 一般将来时。将来要发生的事情 I will love ypu. 我会爱你的，（备胎）

句子组成:

- 一般过去时: 主语 + 动词过去式（did）
- 一般将来时：主语 + will + 动词原型 / 主语 + be going to + 动词原型(do)

#### 一般现在时

主语 + 动词原型或单三（do/does）

单三：单数第三人称，意思就是，在第三人称单数（he, she, it, my father, the dog...）后面的动词要加s或es

I love you.

Mike gives(give) me a book. 迈克给我一本书


#### 一般过去式

语 + 动词过去式（did），过去式的变化，一般情况下，在动词后面直接**加ed**

plant-planted

He planted a tree yesterday. 他昨天种了一棵树

一般过去时, 不规则动词

do -> did 做, go -> went 走、去, buy -> bought 买, send -> sent 送
speak -> spoke 说, sing -> sang 唱, come -> came 来, become -> became 成为

### 定语从句

这是一棵树. Thie is a tree.

这是一颗**高大的**树.  This is a tall tree. 如果定语可以用一个词来表示，就不是从句

只是一颗**我钟的**树. This is a tree + conj.(连词) + I plant.

**修饰名词的成分叫做定语**，conj. + I plant 是定语从句（定语是一个句子）

怎么判断一个句子是否是定语从句
1. 位置：位于名词后面.
2. 标志: that，who，which，when，where
3. 理解：定语从句是指**从句做定语成分修饰前面名词**

e.g.

I have never seen everyone **that could dance like that.**

Those are the students **who saved the cat.**

The house **which was built 20 years ago** is now a city library.

Have you been to the park **where they had patry?**

I will always remember the day **when I met you.**


#### 关系代词与关系副词
定语从句 连接词 为关系词，比如 that, who, which, when, where

This is a tree **that** I plant. 关系代词

I will always remember the day **when** I met you. 关系副词（met meet的过去时）

- 关系代词 (n) who / whom(很少见) / whose / which / that 
- 关系副词 (adv) when / where / why /  prep.(介词) + which / whom

**1.在句子中怎么判断是使用关系代词还是使用关系副词呢？** **看从句子是否缺成分**

当从句却成分时，需要用关系代词，比如 I plant 只有 主 谓 没有宾语，所以要用关系代词

I met you. 从句不缺成分，用关系副词

**2.确定使用关系代词或关系副词后，怎么确定具体用那个呢？**

who/whom 人   whose 谁的  which/that 一般指物，that也可以指人

when 前面的名词是时间， where 前面的名词是地点，why 前面的名词是原因

The man ____ **I talked to** saw the accident. 看见了事故  whom / who / that   主句(see => saw 主句是过去时) + 从句(粗体)

The gift ____ **he bought** wasn’t expensive. which/that (wasn't  是be动词，也是动词)

**从句的划分**
1. **从空格开始画，空格后面只有一个动词，从句画到最后**
2. **从空格开始画，空格后面如果有2个动词，画到第一个动词后面。**

关系代词在从句中充当宾语的时候可以省略

The man I talked to saw the accident.

The gift he bought wasn't expensive.

**3.which和that的区别**

The gift **which/that** he bought me wasn't expensive.

The gift, **which** he boughtme, wasn't expensive.

看到逗号只能用 Which

#### 真题1
The Kilt

Whenever people from Scotland live in foreign countries, they are always asked: "Is Scotland that place where men wears skirts?" The short answers is yes, but there is more about the myths of Scottish "skirts". 

The "Skirt" that Scotsmen(苏格兰男子) sometimes wear is called a kilt. It is part of the traditional dress of Scotland. The kilt is clearly very famous across the world. It seems that everybody has heard of it, and that most people have seen a picture of a man wearing one.

People Knowledge and ideas about Scotsmen wearing these funny kilts come from films and television. Every time people from other countries ask about the kilt, the mention Mel Gibson's film, Braveheart. IN many countries, there are television programmes about Scotland. These programmes always include information or images of men in kilts.

Of course, in Soctland, you will often see the kilt. The **reality** is, though, that you will most commonly see it in tourist areas. The main streets and tourist areas of Scotland always have a Scotsman wearing a kilt and all tourist shops in the country sell kilts in different colours.

But kilts are not something that Scottish people see every day. Kilts are for special occasions, such as weddings, funerals and other big and important events. Scotsmen do not **put on** their kilt just to buy a bottle of milk and a loaf of bread at the local supermaket.

The reason for this may be that kilts are every expensive. When a man wears a kilt, he normally wears it with a special shirt, jacket, socks and shoes. This is obviously not cheap. In fact, an average kilt outfit(全套服装) costs around £ 500.

#### 真题2 
It is estimated that there are more than 8 million restaurants in the world today. So it might surprise you to learn that restaurants as we know have only existed for a few centuries. Before 1765, there were no restaurants. There was nowhere in which a server brought you food and drink that you chose from a menu. In fact, there was no menus anywhere.

There were places where travelers could eat centuries before that. The countryside **was full of** inns that would serve food. And there were bars where one could get a drink. The rich could also eat meals supplied by private cooks. But there was nothing that could be called a "restaurant".

A Frenchman changed that In 1765, he opened a place in Paris that sold soups. On his sign, he used the term "restaurant" to describe what he was selling. Soups were considered "restorative", so he called them "restaurants". Finally, people started buying his soups even when not ill. And as time went on, people began to use the term "restaurant" to refer to the place where soup was sold rather than the soup itself. More "restaurants" opened up in Frence, and people began to buy soups more regularly.
